# Section-Based Video Performance Scoring in Controlled Environments

## Problem
Human athletic performance is judged using subjective criteria such as speed, power, flow, control, and difficulty.  
There is currently no AI system that can score real-world human performance from video in an explainable, judge-aligned way.

Wave pools provide a unique research environment:
- Identical waves
- Fixed geometry
- Repeatable sections
- Reduced environmental noise

This makes it possible to evaluate performance **relative to opportunity**, not subjective style.

## Why This Is Hard
This is not a standard action-recognition problem.

Key challenges include:
- Temporal section segmentation of continuous performance
- Manoeuvre recognition with variable execution quality
- Difficulty-aware scoring (not classification)
- Alignment with expert judging frameworks (ISA / WSL)
- Explainable outputs (“why this scored X”)

## Research Direction
This project explores:
- Section-based scoring models
- Manoeuvre difficulty vs execution quality
- Speed, power, flow, and control metrics
- Pose-based vs raw video approaches
- Human-in-the-loop validation

## Contribution
This is an open research project.

There is:
- No company yet
- No funding pressure
- No product roadmap

Contributors will:
- Work on a real unsolved problem
- Publish openly
- Receive attribution
- Help shape the system direction
